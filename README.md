# COVID-19-Cases-prediction-For-India
This Polynomial Regression model analyse the data after 100th COVID - 19 POSITIVE patient found in INDIA.
This model predicts the number of confirmed patients at the nth day after 100th patient foound in India.
If the curve countinues to increase at the same rate, then it'll look like Graph.png
Hence we need to increase our efforts to flatten the curve unless the worst is yet to come.
The number of patients will keep on incresing the curve did not flatten even after Lockdown - 4.0 
and it will tend to increase in unlocking - 1.0 and further.
